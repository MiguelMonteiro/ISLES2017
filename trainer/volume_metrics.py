    Dice coefficient

    Computes the Dice coefficient (also known as Sorensen index) between the binary
    objects in two images.

    The metric is defined as

        DC=\frac{2|A\cap B|}{|A|+|B|}

    , where :math:`A` is the first and :math:`B` the second set of samples (here: binary objects).

    Parameters
    ----------

    input2 : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.

    Returns

        object(s) in ```input2```. It ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (perfect overlap).

    Notes
    -----
    This is not a real metric, as it is directed. See `assd` for a real metric of this.

    The method is implemented making use of distance images and simple binary morphology
    to achieve high computational speed.

    Examples
    --------
    The `connectivity` determines what pixels/voxels are considered the surface of a
    binary object. Take the following binary image showing a cross

    >>> from scipy.ndimage.morphology import generate_binary_structure
    >>> cross = generate_binary_structure(2, 1)
    array([[0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 1],
           [0, 1, 0]])

    With `connectivity` set to `1` a 4-neighbourhood is considered when determining the
    object surface, resulting in the surface

    .. code-block:: python

        array([[0, 1, 0],
               [1, 0, 1],
               [0, 1, 0]])

    Changing `connectivity` to `2`, a 8-neighbourhood is considered and we get:

    .. code-block:: python

        array([[0, 1, 0],
               [1, 1, 1],
               [0, 1, 0]])

    , as a diagonal connection does no longer qualifies as valid object surface.

    This influences the  results `asd` returns. Imagine we want to compute the surface
    distance of our cross to a cube-like object:

    >>> cube = generate_binary_structure(2, 1)
    array([[1, 1, 1],
           [1, 1, 1],
           [1, 1, 1]])

    , which surface is, independent of the `connectivity` value set, always

    .. code-block:: python

        array([[1, 1, 1],
               [1, 0, 1],
               [1, 1, 1]])

    Using a `connectivity` of `1` we get

    >>> asd(cross, cube, connectivity=1)
    0.0

    while a value of `2` returns us

    >>> asd(cross, cube, connectivity=2)
    0.20000000000000001

    due to the center of the cross being considered surface as well.

    """

    asd = sds.mean()
    return asd


def ravd(input1, input2):
    """
    Relative absolute volume difference.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input1 : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    input2 : array_like

    Returns
    -------
    ravd : float

        :math:`[-1.0, +inf]` for which a :math:`0` denotes an ideal score.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the reference object is empty.

    See also
    --------
    :func:`dc`
    :func:`precision`
    :func:`recall`

    Notes
    -----
    This is not a real metric, as it is directed. Whatever object is considered as
    reference should be passed first. Negative values denote a smaller and positive
    values a larger volume than the reference.

    This implementation does not check, whether the two supplied arrays are of the same
    size.

    Examples
    --------
    Considering the following inputs

    >>> import numpy
    >>> arr1 = numpy.asarray([[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]])
    >>> arr1
    array([[0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 1],
           [0, 1, 0]])
    >>> arr2 = numpy.asarray([[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]])
    >>> arr2
    array([[0, 1, 0],
           [1, 0, 1],
           [0, 1, 0]])

    comparing `arr1` to `arr2` we get

    >>> ravd(arr1, arr2)
    -0.2

    and reversing the inputs the directivness of the metric becomes evident

    >>> ravd(arr2, arr1)
    0.25

    It is important to keep in mind that a perfect score of `0` does not mean that the
    binary objects fit exactely, as only the volumes are compared:

    >>> arr1 = numpy.asarray([1,0,0])
    >>> arr2 = numpy.asarray([0,0,1])

    Influence of `connectivity` parameter can be seen in the following example, where
    with the (default) connectivity of `1` the first array is considered to contain two
    objects, while with an increase connectivity of `2`, just one large object is
    detected.  

    >>> arr1 = numpy.asarray([[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]])

    The false positive rate of distinct binary object detection.

    The false positive rates gives a percentage measure of how many distinct binary
    objects in the second array do not exists in the first array. A partial overlap
    (of minimum one voxel) is here considered sufficient.

    In cases where two distinct binary object in the second array overlap with a single
    distinct object in the first array, only one is considered to have been detected
    successfully and the other is added to the count of false positives.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input1 : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    input2 : array_like
        Input data containing objects. Can be any type but will be converted
        into binary: background where 0, object everywhere else.
    connectivity : int
        The neighbourhood/connectivity considered when determining what accounts
        for a distinct binary object. This value is passed to
        `scipy.ndimage.morphology.generate_binary_structure` and should usually be :math:`> 1`.
        The decision on the connectivity is important, as it can influence the results
        strongly. If in doubt, leave it as it is.

    Returns
    -------
    tpr : float
        A percentage measure of how many distinct binary objects in ``input2`` have no
        corresponding binary object in ``input2``. It has the range :math:`[0, 1]`, where a :math:`0`
        denotes an ideal score.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the second array is empty.

    Notes
    -----
    This is not a real metric, as it is directed. Whatever array is considered as
    reference should be passed first. A perfect score of :math:`0` tells that there are no
    distinct binary objects in the second array that do not exists also in the reference

    existing in the second array (use :func:`obj_tpr` for this).
